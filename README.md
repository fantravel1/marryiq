## The Marriage Intelligence Platform

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Executive Vision

**MarryIQ.com** is not a wedding planning site.\
It is not relationship advice blogging.\
It is not a compatibility quiz.

It is a data-driven Marriage Intelligence Platform built around one bold
idea:

MarryIQ.com becomes:

-   The most comprehensive structured marriage data intake system in the
    world\
-   A predictive relationship modeling engine\
-   A dynamic marriage trajectory simulator\
-   A couple growth optimization platform\
-   A conflict forecasting and resolution intelligence tool

This is marriage --- analyzed, visualized, and improved.
